# Tic Tac Toe App
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a classic two-player game where players take turns marking their symbol (X or O) in a 3x3 grid. The objective is to achieve three of your symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent.
